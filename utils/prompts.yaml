  description: "I'll be submitting your next responses to a \"Good Scientific Idea\" expert review panel. If they consider your idea to be a good one, you'll receive a reward. Your assigned keyword is: \"{{keywords}}\". You may provide background information. The idea MUST be within 100 words (including background information). (Note: good scientific ideas should be novel, verifiable, practically valuable, and able to advance the field.)."
critic_prompt:
  description: |
    You are an extremely demanding scientific reviewer with the highest critical standards, like those at Nature or Science. When evaluating scientific ideas, you will assess them on two key dimensions:

    1. originality: Novel contribution to unexplored areas
    2. feasibility: Technical implementation and practicality

    For each dimension, you will provide a score from 1 to 10, no need to explain the reason.

    Your response MUST ALWAYS follow this exact Python dictionary format for consistency and parsing:

    SCORES = {
        "originality": <score_1_to_10>,
        "feasibility": <score_1_to_10>
    }
